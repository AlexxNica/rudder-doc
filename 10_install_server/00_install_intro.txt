== Install Rudder Server

This chapter covers the installation of a Rudder Root Server, from the
specification of the underlying server, to the initial setup of the application.

Before all, you need to setup a server according to 
<<Server_supported_OS, the server specifications>>. You should also
<<configure_the_network, configure the network>>. These topics are covered in the
Architecture chapter.

Ideally, this machine should have Internet access, but this is not a strict requirement.

As Rudder data can grow really fast depending on your number of managed nodes and number of rules, it is advised to separate partitions to prevent /var getting full and break your system.
Special attention should be given to:

======

/var/lib/pgsql::
(OS dependent).
Please see the <<_database_maintenance, database maintenance>> chapter for more details about the
PostgreSQL database size estimation.

/var/rudder::
Contains most of your server information, the configuration-repository, LDAP database, etc...
Rudder application-related files should stay under 1GB, but the size of the configuration-repository will
depend of the amount of data you store in it, especially in the shared-files folder (files that will get
distributed to the agents using the "Download a file for the shared folder" Technique).

/var/log/rudder:: 
Report logs (/var/log/rudder/reports) size will depend on the amount of nodes you manage.
It is possible to reduce this drastically by unticking "Log all reports received to /var/log/rudder/reports/all.log"
under the Administration - Settings tab in the Rudder web interface. This will prevent Rudder from recording this logs
in a text file on disk, and will only store them in the SQL database. This saves on space, and doesn't remove any
functionality, but does however make debugging harder.
