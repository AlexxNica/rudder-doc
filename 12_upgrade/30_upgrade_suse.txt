[WARNING]

====

SLES 11 uses PostgreSQL 8.3 by default, which is not supported by Rudder and will cause various glitches
in the web interface, as well as reporting failures.

It is really mandatory to migrate to PostgreSQL 8.4 at least (9.1+ is recommended).

Please look at <<install-server-sles>> for details.

====

and after the upgrade of these packages, restart jetty to be sure that the changes are applied:

----

service rudder-jetty restart

----

For Rudder Agent, upgrade the +rudder-agent+ package:

----

zypper update rudder-agent

----

You can now <<_technique_upgrade,upgrade your local techniques>>.
