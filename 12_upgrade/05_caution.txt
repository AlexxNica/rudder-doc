=== Caution cases

==== Compatibility between Rudder server 3.1 and older agent versions

===== 2.11.x, 3.0.X and 3.1.x agents

As they use a compatible CFEngine version, Rudder agent 2.11.x, 3.0.x and 3.1.x are fully compatible with Rudder server 3.2.x. It is therefore not necessary to update your agents to 3.2.x.

However, Rudder 3.1 provided a new inventory signing feature which will only be enabled on nodes running Rudder 3.1 or 3.2 agents. On nodes running an older agent version, the inventories won't be signed. 

===== 2.10.x or older

These agents are not compatible with Rudder 3.2, and you have to upgrade them. 
Be careful to follow the upgrade path explained <<_upgrade_from_rudder_2_10_or_older, above>>.

==== Known issues

* After upgrade, if the web interface has display problems, empty your navigator cache and/or logout/login.
