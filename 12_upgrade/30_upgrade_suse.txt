[WARNING]

====

SLES 11 uses PostgreSQL 8.3 by default, which is not supported by Rudder and will cause various glitches
in the web interface, as well as reporting failures.

It is really mandatory to migrate to PostgreSQL 8.4 at least (9.1+ is recommended).

Please look at <<install-server-sles>> for details.

====

[WARNING]

====

Rudder 4.1 requires Java RE version 8 or more, which is not packaged be default on SLES 11
On this platform, prior to upgrade Rudder, you will need to install Java RE 8, either from Oracle site https://www.java.com
or through any other means of your choice

====

and after the upgrade of these packages, restart jetty to apply the changes on the Web application:

----

service rudder-jetty restart

----

For Rudder Agent, upgrade the +rudder-agent+ package:

----

zypper update rudder-agent
