=== Install Rudder Root server on RedHat or CentOS

==== Java on RHEL/CentOS

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible 'Java Runtime Environment' to run.

On RHEL/CentOS 6, the available package compatible with Rudder server is
+java-1.7.0-openjdk+ but Rudder is also compatible with Oracle JRE 1.6 or later.

Oracle JRE 1.6, Oracle JRE 1.7 and OpenJDK 1.6 aren't provided by the same virtual package on
RHEL/CentOS 6 than OpenJDK 1.7. Besides, only OpenJDK 1.7 is provided by default on
RHEL/CentOS contrary to Oracle JRE.

This is why even if Rudder Server would work with Oracle JRE 1.6 or 1.7, the
dependencies will not be resolved with them.

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

Run the following command as root:

**RedHat/CentOS 6:**

----

echo "[Rudder_2.6]
name=Rudder 2.6 Repository
baseurl=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.6/RHEL_6/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.6/RHEL_6/repodata/repomd.xml.key
" > /etc/yum.repos.d/rudder.repo

----

**RedHat/CentOS 5:**

----

echo "[Rudder_2.6]
name=Rudder 2.6 Repository
baseurl=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.6/RHEL_5/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.6/RHEL_5/repodata/repomd.xml.key
" > /etc/yum.repos.d/rudder.repo

----

==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

yum install rudder-server-root

----

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.

[WARNING]

====

Rudder doesn't support SELinux yet (see http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2882),
so you should set it to be permissive with this command:

----

setenforce 0

----
