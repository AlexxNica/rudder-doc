  Authorizations
    You must define a role attribute to every user you add.
  A role is defined by a list of authorizations separated by commas.
  There are two kind of authorizations :

  Predefined authorizations

  There are 7 predefined authorization levels:
    - administrator (all rights)
    - administration_only (all administration)
    - user (all node, configuration)
    - configuration(all configuration)
    - read_only (read all)
    - compliance(read rule)
    - inventory (read node)

  There is three predefined roles for change request rights:
    - validator (Can valid changes)
    - deployer  (Can deploy changes)
    - workflow  (Both deployer and validator)
  The administrator role include the workflow ones

  Custom authorizations

  Custom authorisations are composed of two elements:
    - A type of authorization, which define what is concerned
      there's is 10 types, which are : node, group, deployement,
      administration, configuration, rule, technique, directive,
      validator and deployer.
    - A level of authorization,
      levels are: read, write, edit, all(read, write, edit)
      They are not inclusive (write and edit don't include read,)
      a custom authorisation has a format like that "type_level" like "node_all", "group_read"

  Examples

      <user name="alice"  password="xxxxxxx" role="administrator" />
      <user name="bob"    password="xxxxxxx" role="read_only"/>
      <user name="carol"  password="xxxxxxx" role="user,validator"/>

      <user name="custom" password="custom" role="node_all,configuration_read,rule_read,rule_edit,directive_read,technique_read">
      - can read everything but administration,groups and deployement
      - can do everything about node
