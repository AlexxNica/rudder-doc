==== Install Rudder Root server on Debian or Ubuntu

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

Run the following commands as root:

----

apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 474A19E8
echo "deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-2.11/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list
aptitude update

----

This will add the GPG key used to sign the Rudder repository, then add the
package repository itself and finally update the local package cache.


[TIP]

=====

If the HTTP Keyserver Protocol (11371/tcp) port is blocked on your network you
can use this alternate command:

----

wget --quiet -O- "http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x474A19E8" | sudo apt-key add -

----

===== Java on Debian/Ubuntu

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible 'Java Runtime Environment' to run.
In most cases, this will be installed automatically thanks to packaging
dependencies, however in some cases manual installation is required.

On 'Debian Wheezy (7)' and above and 'Ubuntu Precise (12.04)' and above, the
available package is 'OpenJDK 7 JRE', namely +openjdk-7-jre+. It will be
installed automatically as a dependency of the Rudder packages, and does not
require the non-free component.

On 'Debian Squeeze (6)' and 'Debian Lenny (5)', the available package is 'Oracle Java 6
JRE', namely +sun-java-6-jre+, which is in the 'non-free' component. You must
make sure this is enabled in your apt sources. Check that
+/etc/apt/sources.list+ contains the following lines:

----

deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

----
[TIP]

=====

Your mirror may differ, +ftp.fr.debian.org+ is only an example. Also, please
adapt the distribution name if needed (+squeeze+ could be replaced by +lenny+).

=====


On 'Ubuntu Natty (11.04)' and previous Ubuntu versions, you will have to
install Java yourself as the packaging of the Oracle JVM is now restricted by
Oracle(TM) and Rudder is not compatible with OpenJDK 6, which is the only
available JDK from Ubuntu. See http://www.java.com/fr/download/ to get
Oracle's JVM.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

aptitude install rudder-server-root

----

[NOTE]

=====

If 'Oracle Java 6 JRE' is installed (usually on Debian Lenny (5) or Squeeze
(6) only), you will be asked to accept the license of the product during
installation.

=====

===== Incompatibility between Rudder server on Ubuntu and Rudder agents using syslog (RHEL/CentOS 5)

[WARNING]

=====

Any nodes running *syslogd* (not syslog-ng or rsyslog) will *fail* to send any
reports about the configuration rules they have applied to a Rudder Server running
on Ubuntu (and only on Ubuntu). Rudder will apply rules on nodes but will never get
reports from them. Therefore Rudder will not be able to calculate compliance.

The only supported platform using syslogd by default is *RHEL/CentOS 5*, and several
workarounds are available to fix this:

. Install another syslog server on your nodes, such as rsyslog or syslog-ng.
. Change the rsyslog configuration on the Rudder server (running Ubuntu 12.04
  or later) to use port 514 and authorize this in the rsyslog configuration.
. Setup iptables on the node to send syslog traffic to the correct port on
  your Rudder server.
. Use a different OS for your Rudder server that Ubuntu Server 12.04 or later.

=====

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.
