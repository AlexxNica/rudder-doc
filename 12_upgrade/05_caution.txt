=== Caution cases

==== Upgrading from Rudder 2.8

Rudder 2.9.* and Rudder 2.8.* use the same CFEngine version, and no changes were made to the agent package apart its name. Therefore Rudder agent 2.8.* are fully compatible with Rudder server 2.9.*, so it is not necessary to update your agents to 2.9.*.

To have a successful upgrade, you only need to upgrade Rudder server to 2.9.
 
==== Upgrading from Rudder 2.4, 2.6 or 2.7

Rudder 2.9.* contains CFEngine 3.5.2 which is more strict with the parsing of its promises. To have a successful upgrade these steps should be followed:

* Make sure the Rudder server to be upgraded is in a version that is at least 2.4.11, 2.6.8 and 2.7.5 before attempting to upgrade to 2.9.*

* Ensure that all node's promises have been regenerated since the server upgrade to this version (don't forget that your Techniques will not be upgraded automatically)
** On Rudder WebUI, at the top right of the screen, click on 'Regenerate now'
** On Rudder 2.6 or later, you can use the API from the server with this command: 'curl http://localhost/rudder/api/deploy/reload'

* Upgrade all agents connected to that server to 2.9.* or 2.8.*

* Upgrade the Rudder server to 2.9

==== Known bugs

* After upgrade, if the web interface has display problems, empty your navigator cache
and/or logout/login.
