==== Install Rudder Root server on RHEL-like systems

===== Java on RHEL/CentOS

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible 'Java Runtime Environment' to run.

On RHEL/CentOS 6, the available package compatible with Rudder server is
+java-1.7.0-openjdk+ but Rudder is also compatible with Oracle JRE 1.6 or later.

Oracle JRE 1.6, Oracle JRE 1.7 and OpenJDK 1.6 aren't provided by the same virtual package on
RHEL/CentOS 6 than OpenJDK 1.7. Besides, only OpenJDK 1.7 is provided by default on
RHEL/CentOS contrary to Oracle JRE.

This is why even if Rudder Server would work with Oracle JRE 1.6 or 1.7, the
dependencies will not be resolved with them.

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

include::snippets/rpm_key.txt.snippet[]

Then run the following command as root:

**RHEL/CentOS 6:**

----

echo "[Rudder_2.11]
name=Rudder 2.11 Repository
baseurl=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.11/RHEL_6/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.11/RHEL_6/repodata/repomd.xml.key
" > /etc/yum.repos.d/rudder.repo

----

**RHEL/CentOS 5:**

----

echo "[Rudder_2.11]
name=Rudder 2.11 Repository
baseurl=http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.11/RHEL_5/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.11/RHEL_5/repodata/repomd.xml.key
" > /etc/yum.repos.d/rudder.repo

----

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

yum install rudder-server-root

----

On RHEL-like systems, a firewall setup is enabled by default, and would need to be adjusted
for Rudder to operate properly. You have to allow all the flows described in the
<<configure_the_network, Network>> section.

[WARNING]

=====

Rudder doesn't support SELinux yet (see http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2882),
so you should set it to be permissive with this command:

----

setenforce 0

----
=====

[TIP]

=====

The webapp runs on HTTPS/443 port so you need to allow access to your server on this port.
The file to edit is /etc/sysconfig/iptables and should look like 

----

*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# allow SSH access
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# allow HTTP access
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
# allow HTTPS access
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
COMMIT

----

The important line to have access to the Web interface being: 

----

# allow HTTPS access
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

----

=====

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.
