=== Caution cases

==== Upgrading from Rudder 2.11

Rudder 2.11.* use a compatible CFEngine version. Therefore, Rudder agent 2.11.* are fully compatible with Rudder server 3.0.*, so it is not necessary to update your agents to 3.0.*.

To have a successful upgrade, you only need to upgrade Rudder server to 3.0.
 
==== Upgrading from Rudder 2.6 or 2.10

Rudder 2.6.* and 2.10.* contain an older CFEngine version. To have a successful upgrade these steps should be followed:

* Make sure the Rudder server to be upgraded to the latest 2.6 or 2.10 version before attempting to upgrade to 3.0.*

* Ensure that all node's promises have been regenerated since the server upgrade to this version (don't forget that your Techniques will not be upgraded automatically)
** On Rudder WebUI, at the top right of the screen, click on 'Regenerate now'
** You can use the API from the server with this command: 'curl http://localhost/rudder/api/deploy/reload'

* Upgrade all agents connected to that server to 3.0.*.

* Upgrade the Rudder server to 3.0

==== Known issues

* After upgrade, if the web interface has display problems, empty your navigator cache and/or logout/login.
