==== Asset management concepts

Each Node is running a Rudder Agent, which is sending regularly an inventory to
the Rudder Server.

===== New Nodes

Following the first inventory, Nodes are placed in a transit zone. You can then view
the detail of their inventory, and accept the final Node in the Rudder database if desired.
You may also reject the Node, if it is not a machine you would like to manage with Rudder.

===== Search Nodes

An advanced search engine allows you to identify the required Nodes (by name, IP
address, OS, versions, etc.)

===== Groups of Nodes 

You will have to create sets of Nodes, called groups. These groups are derived from search results, and can either be static or a dynamic :
