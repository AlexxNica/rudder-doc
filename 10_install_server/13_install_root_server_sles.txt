=== Install Rudder Root server on SLES

==== Configure the package manager

Rudder requires three packages that are not always packaged by SuSE on all versions:

* rsyslog-psql
* PostgreSQL 9
* Java RE (version 7 at least).

The first one is present in Rudder's repositories and can be downloaded alongside Rudder as a dependency, but you
will need to install PostgeSQL 9 and a Java RE separately.

PostgreSQL 9 can be installed through the OpenSuSE build service: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/server:database:postgresql

The Java RE 7 can be found either using the OpenSuSE build service, or through Oracle's website: http://www.java.com

Also, Rudder server requires the +git+ software, that can be found on SLES SDK DVD under the name +git-core+.

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

Run the following commands as root:

----

zypper ar -n "Rudder SLES repository" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-3.0/SLES_11/ Rudder
zypper ref

----

This will add the Rudder package repository, then update the local package
cache.

==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

zypper in rudder-server-root

----

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.

[WARNING]

====

Zypper seems to be quite tolerant to missing dependencies and will let you install rudder-server-root even if you are missing
something like +git-core+ for example, if nothing provides it or you did not install it beforehand.

Special care should be taken during initial installation not to say "Continue anyway" if Zypper does complain a dependency can
not be resolved and asks what to do.
