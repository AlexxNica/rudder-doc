=== Initial configuration of your Rudder Root Server

After the installation, you have to configure some system elements, by launching
the following initialization script:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-init

----

This script will ask you to fill in the following details:

====

Allowed networks:: A list of IP networks authorized to connect to the server. We
recommend that you specify all the networks of your infrastructure. The syntax
is the standard network/mask notation, for instance +192.168.0.0/24+ or
+10.0.0.0/8+. To add several networks, first type the first network, then press
the return key - the script will ask if you wish to add some more networks.

====

[TIP]

====

In case of typing error, or if you wish to reconfigure Rudder, you can
execute this script again as many times as you want.
