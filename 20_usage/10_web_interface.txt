=== Presentation of Rudder Web Interface

The web interface is organised according to the concepts described earlier. It
is divided in three logical parts: Asset Management, Configuration Management
and Administration.

==== Rudder Home

The home page summarizes the content of the other parts and provides quick links
for the most common actions.
