=== Install Rudder Root server on SLES

==== Configure the package manager

Ensure that the +zypper+ package manager is configured, and install the required packages:
+rsyslog+, +rsyslog-pgsql+ and 'Oracle Java 6 JRE' or 'OpenJDK 7 JRE'. +rsyslog+ and +rsyslog-pgsql+ are downloadable
alongside Rudder and Java is available through Oracle's website: http://www.java.com.

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

Run the following commands as root:

----

zypper ar -n "Normation RPM Repositories" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.10/SLES_11_SP1/ Normation
zypper up

----

This will add the Rudder package repository, then update the local package
cache.

==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

zypper in rudder-server-root

----

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.

[TIP]

====

If you want to manage the Techniques Library with 'git' on a SLES based
system, you should download the 'SDK DVD' and install +git-core+ using +yast2+ or
+zypper+, or get the RPM using another channel.
