=== What is Rudder?

Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure
Automation and Compliance. With a focus on continuously checking configurations
and centralising real-time status data, Rudder can show a high-level summary
(_ISO 27001 rules are at 100%!_) and break down noncompliance issues to a deep
technical level (_Host prod-web-03: SSH server configuration allows root logins_).

A few things that make Rudder stand out: 

* A *simple framework* allows you to *extend the built-in rules* to implement
  specific low-level configuration patterns, however complex they may be, using
  simple building blocks (_ensure package installed in version X_, _ensure file content_,
  _ensure line in file_, etc.). A graphical builder lowers the technical level required to use this. 
* Each policy can be independently set to be automatically *checked or enforced* 
  on a policy or host level. In Enforce mode, each remediation action is recorded,
  showing the value of these invisible fixes. 
* Rudder works on almost *every kind of device*, so you’ll be managing physical 
  and virtual servers in the data center, cloud instances, and embedded IoT devices
  in the same way. 
* Rudder is designed for *critical environments* where a *security* breach can mean
  more than a blip in the sales stats. Built-in features include change requests, 
  audit logs, and strong authentication. 
* Rudder relies on an agent that needs to be installed on all hosts to audit. 
  The *agent is very lightweight* (10 to 20 MB of RAM at peak) and *blazingly fast*
  (it’s written in C and takes less than 10 seconds to verify 100 rules). Installation
  is self-contained, via a single package, and can auto-update to limit agent
  management burden. 
* Rudder is a *true and professional open source* solution—the team behind Rudder
  doesn’t believe in the dual-speed licensing approach that makes you reinstall
  everything and promotes open source as little more than a “demo version.”

Rudder is an established project with *several 10000s of node managed*, in companies
from small to biggest-in-their-field. Typical deployments manage 100s to 1000s of nodes.
The biggest known deployment in 2017 is about 7000 nodes.
