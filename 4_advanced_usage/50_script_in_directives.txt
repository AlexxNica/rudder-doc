=== JavaScript evaluation in Directives

It is possible to use JavaScript expressions to build Directive values. The
resulting values will be computed during policy generation, and can therefore
provide unique values for each node.

==== Feature availability

This feature was introduced in Rudder 3.1.12, Rudder 3.2.5 and Rudder 4.0.

If you upgraded to 3.1.12 (or a later 3.1.x version) or 3.2.5 (or a later 3.2.x
version) from a previous Rudder version, this feature is disabled by default
in order to mitigate any risk of undesired side effects on existing
installations. You can enable it in the Administration/Settings page, using the
*Enable script evaluation in Directives* parameter.

Rudder installations from 4.0 onwards have this feature enabled by default.

==== Usage

Currently, use of JavaScript is only supported in the "password" variable type
in Directives, for example in the "User Management" technique. Its
availability will be extended to all Directive fields in the near future (see
below).

All standard JavaScript methods are available, and a Rudder-specific
library, prefixed with `rudder.` also provides some extra utilities. This
library is documented below.

For example, to get the first 3 letters of each node's hostname, you can write:
----
"${rudder.node.hostname}".substring(0,3)
----

.Limitation of the scripting language

====

JavaScript expressions are evaluated in a sandboxed JavaScript environment. It has some
limitations, such as:

* It cannot write on the filesystem
* Scripts are killed after 5 seconds of execution, to prevent overloading the system

==== Rudder utility library

===== Standard hash methods

The following methods allow to simply hash a value using standard algorithms:

* `rudder.hash.md5(string)`
* `rudder.hash.sha256(string)`
* `rudder.hash.sha512(string)`

These methods do not use a salt for hashing, and as such are not suitable for
distributing passwords for user accounts on UNIX systems. See below for a
preferable approach for this.

===== UNIX password-compatible hash methods

The following methods are specially designed to provided hashes that can be
used as user passwords on UNIX systems (in `/etc/shadow`, for example). Use
these if you want to distribute hashes of unique passwords for each of your
nodes, for example.

Two different cases exist: support for generic Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD,
...) and support for AIX systems (which use a different hash algorithm).

Available methods are:

* `rudder.password.auto(algorithm, password [, salt])`
* `rudder.password.unix(algorithm, password [, salt])`
* `rudder.password.aix(algorithm, password [, salt])`

The parameters are:

* `algorithm` can be "MD5", "SHA-512", "SHA512", "SHA-256", "SHA256" (case insensitive)
* `password` is the plain text password to hash
* `salt` is the optional salt to use in the password (we *strongly* recommend providing this value - see warning below)

The `unix` method generates Unix crypt password compatible hashes (for use on
Linux, BSD, etc), while the `aix` method generates AIX password compatible
hashes. The `auto` method automatically uses the appropriate algorithm for
each node type (AIX nodes will have a AIX compatible hash, others will
have a Unix compatible hash). We recommend always using `auto` for simplicity.

For example, to use the first 8 letters of each node's hostname as a password,
you could write:
----
rudder.password.auto("SHA-256", "${rudder.node.hostname}".substring(0,8), "abcdefg")
----

[WARNING]

.Providing a salt

====

It is strongly recommended to provide a *salt* to the methods above. If no
salt is provided, a random salt is created, and will be recreated at each
policy generation, causing the resulting hashes to change each time. This, in
turn, will generate an unnecessary "repaired" status for the password component on all nodes
at each policy generation.

====

[TIP]

.JVM requirements for AIX password hashes

====

AIX password generation depends on the availability of *PBKDF2WithHmac256* and
*PBKDF2WithHmac512* in the JVM. Some JVMs don't include these libraries. In
this case, the hashing algorithm falls back to *SHA1*, and an error message
will be logged.

====

==== Status and future support

In a future version of Rudder, JavaScript evaluation will be supported in all
fields in Directives.

In the meantime, you can already test this functionality out by entering a JavaScript
expression in any Directive field, prefixed by "evaljs:". Please be aware that
this is unsupported and untested, so do this at your own risk.

If you do encounter any issues, please get in touch or open a ticket - we'd
love to hear about them!

There is currently no plan to extend this support to the fields in the
Technique editor.
