=== Policy Template upgrade

New versions of the Policy Template library are made available as packages,
named rudder-policy-templates, for the 2.3 version of Rudder. Many bug fixes
and new Policy Templates are added all the time. To benefit from these, we
recommend you upgrade your Policy Template library from time to time.

Updates are available from rudder-project.org, as standard OS package
downloads. Please note that nightly builds are also available, and may provide
the most up to date set of Policy Templates. See
http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Download/ for full details.

When you upgrade the Rudder Policy Templates packages to a new version, a
new version of the Policy Template library is installed to /opt/rudder/share/policy-templates.

The Policy Template library used by Rudder is managed using a GIT tree,
located in /var/rudder/configuration-repository/policy-templates.
Therefore, you can not simply copy the files from /opt/rudder/share/policy-templates to Rudder's
storage, you also have to follow this simple procedure:

[TIP] 

====

Please make sure that any changes you make are on a new version of a Policy Template,
or you are likely to have your changes replaced by the reference library!
Of course, GIT will keep history if your modifications are already commited but this would be
an annoyance.
