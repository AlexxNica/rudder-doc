=== Install Rudder Root server on Debian or Ubuntu

==== Java on Debian/Ubuntu

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible 'Java Runtime Environment' to run. 

On 'Debian Squeeze' and 'Debian Lenny', the available package is 'Oracle Java 6
JRE', namely +sun-java-6-jre+, which is in the 'non-free' component. 

On 'Debian Wheezy' and above and 'Ubuntu Oneiric' and above, the available package is
'OpenJDK 7 JRE', namely +openjdk-7-jre+.

On 'Ubuntu Natty' and previous, you will have to install Java yourself as the
packaging of the Sun JVM is now restricted by Oracle(TM) and Rudder is not
OpenJDK 6 compatible.

===== On Debian Squeeze or Lenny, add the main, contrib and non-free components

Ensure that the +apt+ package manager is configured to use these three components,
by checking that +/etc/apt/sources.list+ contains the following lines:

----

deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

----

[TIP]

====

Your mirror may differ, +ftp.fr.debian.org+ is only an example. Also, please
adapt the distribution name if needed.

Your linux distribution may differ too, +squeeze+ could be replaced by +lenny+.

==== Update the system

Prior to beginning the installation of your Rudder Server, we recommend that you
update your Debian/Ubuntu system with the latest versions of available packages.
Especially for Debian, since the release of Debian 6.0 (Squeeze), the signing key of
packages repositories has changed. If you haven't already done it, you should
force the upgrade of the +debian-archive-keyring+ package to fetch the new key:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install debian-archive-keyring
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude safe-upgrade

----

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

To validate the content of the Normation repository, you should import the GPG
key used to sign it:

----

root@rudder-server:~# apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 474A19E8

----

if your HTTP Keyserver Protocol (11371/tcp) is blocked you can use an alternate command:

----

root@rudder-server:~# wget --quiet -O- "http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x474A19E8" | sudo apt-key add -

----


Then add the URL of the Normation repository, by typing the next command:

----

root@rudder-server:~# echo 'deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-2.4/ $(lsb_release -cs) main contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list

----

Then, update your local package database to retrieve the list of packages
available on our repository:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update

----

==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install rudder-server-root

----

[NOTE]

====

If you use the 'Oracle Java 6 JRE', you will be asked to accept the license of
the product during installation.
