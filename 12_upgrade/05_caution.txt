=== Caution cases

Rudder 2.11.* onwards contains a new CFEngine version (3.6) which is more strict with the parsing of its promises and introduces new promise attributes.

To have a successful upgrade these steps should be followed:

* Make sure the Rudder server to be upgraded to the last 2.6 or 2.10 version, depending on the one you are currently running.

* Ensure that all node's promises have been regenerated since the server upgrade to this version (don't forget that your Techniques will not be upgraded automatically, follow the <<_technique_upgrade, Technique Upgrade>> section to upgrade them manually)
** On Rudder WebUI, at the top right of the screen, click on 'Regenerate now'
** You can use the API from the server with this command: 'curl http://localhost/rudder/api/deploy/reload'

* Upgrade all agents connected to that server to 2.11.*

* Upgrade the Rudder server to 2.11

==== Known bugs

* After upgrade, if the web interface has display problems, empty your navigator cache and/or logout/login.
