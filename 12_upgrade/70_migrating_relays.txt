=== Upgrade manually installed relays

With Rudder 2.11, there were no relay package and the configuration had to be done by hand.

To migrate a manually installed relay to 3.1 using the package, run the following intructions:

* Delete the previous Apache configuration file:
 
** `/etc/httpd/conf.d/rudder-default.conf file` on RHEL-like
** `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rudder-default` file on Debian-like
** `/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/rudder-default.conf` file on SuSE 

* Install the relay package named *rudder-server-relay*.

This is enough to replace the relay configuration, and no change is needed on the root server.
