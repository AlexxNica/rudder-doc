==== Install Rudder Root server on SLES

===== Configure the package manager

Ensure that the +zypper+ package manager is configured, and install 'Oracle Java 6 JRE' or 'OpenJDK 7 JRE',
for example available on Oracle's website: http://www.java.com.

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

include::snippets/rpm_key.txt.snippet[]

Then run the following commands as root:

----

zypper ar -n "Normation RPM Repositories" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.11/SLES_11_SP1/ Normation
zypper refresh

----

This will add the Rudder package repository, then update the local package
cache.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

zypper in rudder-server-root

----

[TIP]

=====

If you want to manage the Techniques Library with 'git' on a SLES based
system, you should download the 'SDK DVD' and install +git-core+ using +yast2+ or
+zypper+, or get the RPM using another channel.

=====

Now jump to <<initial-config,the next section to configure your server>>.
