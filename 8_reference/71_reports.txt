=== Reports reference

This page describes the concept behind the reporting in Rudder, and specifically how to write the Techniques to get proper reporting in Rudder

==== Concepts

Each Technique, when converted into a Directive and applied to a Node, must generate reports for Rudder to get proper compliance reports. This reports must contains specific information :

   * The Report type, that can be logs for information purpose or result to express a compliance
   * The Rule Id (autogenerated)
   * The Directive Id (autogenerated)
   * The Version Id (revision of the Rule) (autogenerated)
   * The name of the component the report is related to
   * The value of the key variable in the component (or None if not available)
   * The Execution Timestamp, to know in which execution of the agent the promise has been generated

These reports are sent via Syslog to the Rudder Root Server, parsed and put in a database, that is queried to generate the reporting

==== Report format

A report has the following format :

----

@@Technique@@Type@@RuleId@@DirectiveId@@VersionId@@Component@@Key@@ExecutionTimeStamp##NodeId@#HumanReadableMessage

----

   * Technique : Human readable Technique name
   * Type : type of report (see bellow)
   * RuleId : The Id of the Configuration Rule, autogenerated
   * DirectiveId : The Id of the Directive, autogenerated
   * VersionId : the revision of the ConfigurationRule, autogenerated
   * Component : the name of the component this Directive is related to (if no component are defined in the metadata.xml, then the Technique name is used)
   * Key : the value of the reference variable. If there is no reference variable, then the value None should be used
   * ExecutionTimeStamp : the timestamp of the current CFEngine execution
   * NodeId : the id of the node
   * HumanReadableMessage : a message than a Human can understand

.Report Types
|===
| Name
| Type 
| Max number 
| Details

| log_trace 
| log 
| infinity 
| Should be used for advanced debuging purpose only

| log_debug 
| log 
| infinity 
| Should be used for debug purpose only

| log_info 
| log 
| infinity 
| Use for standard logging purposes

| log_warn 
| log 
| infinity 
| Used for logging only for the moment. Should be used when something unexpected happens

| log_repaired 
| log 
| infinity 
| Used for logging purposes, to list all that is repaired by the promises

| result_na 
| result 
| one per component/key 
| Defines the status of the Component to Not Applicable (if there are no result_success, result_repaired, result_error) Should be used only when everything is already in the correct state in this component for this key

| result_success 
| result 
| one per component/key 
| Defines the status of the Component to Success (if there are no result_repaired or result_error) Should be used only when everything is already in the correct state in this component for this key

| result_repaired 
| result 
| one per component/key 
| Defines the status of the Component to Repaired (if there are no result_error) Should be used only when something was not in the correct state, but could be corrected

| result_error 
| result 
| infinity per component/key 
| Defines the status of the Component to Error Should be used when something was not in the correct state, and could not be corrected

Variables used to generate the reports

Some facilities have been created to help putting the right values at the right place

   * `&TRACKINGKEY&`: this is an auto generated variable, put in the technique file, that Rudder will replace when writing the promises by

----

<pre>RuleId@@DirectiveId@@VersionId

----

   * `$(g.execRun)`: this is replaced at runtime by CFEngine 3 to the current execution time
   * `$(g.uuid)`: this is replaced at runtime by CFEngine 3 to the Node Id
