.Unsupported Operating Systems

====

It is possible to use Rudder on other platforms than the ones listed here.
However, we haven't tested the application on them, and can't currently supply
any packages for them. Moreover, some Techniques may not work properly. If you
wish to try Rudder on other systems, please get in touch with us!
