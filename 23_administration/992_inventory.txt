=== Use Rudder inventory in other tools

Rudder centralizes the information about your managed systems, and
you can use this information in other tools, mainly through the API.
We well here give a few examples.

==== Export to a spreadsheet

You can export the list of your nodes to a spreadsheet file (xls format) by using a 
https://github.com/normation/rudder-tools/tree/master/contrib/rudder_nodes_list[tool] available in the rudder-tools repository.

Simple follow the installation instructions, and run it against your Rudder server.
You will get a file containing:

You can easily modify the script to add other information.

==== Use the inventory in Rundeck

http://rundeck.org[Rundeck] is a tool that helps automating infrastructures, by
defining jobs that can be run manually or automatically. There is a 
http://rundeck.org/plugins/2015/12/02/rudder-nodes.html[plugin] for Rundeck
that allows using Rudder inventory data in Rundeck.

==== Use the inventory in Ansible

There is an https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/rudder.py[inventory plugin] 
for Ansible that makes possible to use Rudder inventory (including groups, nodes, 
group ids, node ids, and node properties) as inventory for Ansible, for example
for orchestration tasks on your platform.
