=== Caution cases

==== Known bugs (2.4.0~beta3)

* Upgrade doesn't work if the user has changed the LDAP password to use a hashed
one. A workaround is to use a plain-text password instead
(cf http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2821).

* Upgrade on SLES 11 doesn't remove rudder-cfengine-community package and will
 install both rudder-agent and rudder-cfengine-community. At this time, no
 consequences of any impact have been noticed but be cautious
(cf http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2806).

* On SLES 11, Techniques associated to the 2.4.0~beta3 rudder-techniques package
contain a buggy logrotate configuration (cf
http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2820). This is already fixed and
will be released in subsequent versions (2.4.0~beta4 or 2.4.0~rc1 or 2.4.0).

* On all systems, any existing users defined in
  /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml will no longer have admin rights in 2.4. To
  fix this manually, add 'role="administrator"' to the users in that file. See
  http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2822.

* After upgrade if the web interface has display problems, empty you navigator cache
and/or logout/login or check that the attribute 'base.url' in your '/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties'
has not been reset.
