==== Quick Search

The easiest search tool is the Quick search: type in the search field the first
letters of the 'Rudder ID', 'Reference', or 'Hostname'; choose the accurate Node in
the autocompletion list; validate and look at the Node informations. This search
tool can be very useful to help you create a new search in the Advanced Search.

.Quick search the Node called +debian-node+

====

Assuming you have one managed Node called +debian-node.rudder-project.org+,
which ID in Rudder is +d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f+. 

. Type in the Quick Search field the +de+ or +d0+.

. Autocompletion will propose you this Node: +debian-node.rudder-project.org --
d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f [d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f]+.

==== Advanced Search 

In the Advanced Search tool, you create complex research based on Asset
Inventory informations. The benefit of the Advanced Search tool is to save the
query and create a Group of Nodes based on the search criteria.

- 1. Select a field

The selection of the field upon which the criteria will apply is a two step
process. The list of fields is not displayed unordered and extensively. Fields
have been grouped in the same way they are displayed when you look at
information about a Node. First you choose among these groups: 'Node', 'Network
Interface', 'Filesystem', 'Machine', 'RAM', 'Storage', 'BIOS', 'Controller',
'Port', 'Processor', 'Sound Card', 'Video Card', 'Software'; then you choose
among the list of fields concerning this theme.

- 2. Select the matching rule

// FIXME: due to a bug in asciidoc, we cannot write '≠' 

The matching rule can be selected between following possibilities: 'Is defined',
'Is not defined', '=' or ≠  followed by the term you are searching for presence or
absence. Depending on the field, the list of searchable terms is either an free
text field, either the list of available terms. 

- 3. Add another rule

You can select only one term for each matching rule. If you want to create more
complex search, then you can add another rule using the '+' icon. All rules are
using the same operand, either 'AND' or 'OR'. More complex searches mixing 'AND'
and 'OR' operands are not available at the moment.

.Advanced search for Linux Nodes with +ssh+.

====

Assuming you want to search every Linux Nodes having +ssh+ installed. You will
create this 2 lines request:

. Operator: +AND+.

. First search line: +Node+, +Operating System+, +=+, +Linux+.

. Second search line: +Software+, +Name+, +=+, +ssh+.
