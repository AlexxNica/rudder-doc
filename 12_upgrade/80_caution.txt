=== Caution cases

==== Known bugs (2.4.0~beta3)

* Upgrade doesn't work if the user has changed the LDAP password to use a hashed
one. A workaround is to use a plain-text password instead
(cf http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2821).

* Upgrade on SLES 11 doesn't remove rudder-cfengine-community package and will
 install both rudder-agent and rudder-cfengine-community. At this time, no bad
consequences has been notice but be cautious
(cf http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2806).

* On SLES and RHEL, Techniques associated to the 2.4.0~beta3 rudder-techniques package
contain a wrong logrotate. (cf http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/2820)
