=== Application tuning

Some applications used by Rudder can be tuned to your needs, like Apache HTTPd.

==== Apache HTTPd

The apache HTTPd is used by Rudder as a proxying server, to connect to the Jetty
application server.

But it is also widely used as a regular HTTP serving application. You are heavily
advised if interested to read the tons of documentation about it in your Linux
distribution website, to learn about what it can do.

==== Jetty

The Jetty 7 (Hightide) application server is the main application that runs the
Rudder code. It is based on the Java programming language.

About the latter, there is some configuration switches that you might want to
tune to obtain better performance with Rudder, in /etc/default/jetty, whereas the
default ones fit the basic recommandations for the minimal Rudder hardware requirements.

* -Xms and Xmx: These parameters tune the total amount of RAM usable / dedicated to the
java process. It is what you want to tune at first to give Rudder some more RAM.

* -XX:PermSize -XX:MaxPermSize: These parameters are acceptable for most installations,
but you might want to decrease them a bit if using a machine that is not very powerful /
RAM abundant. Increasing them is not really useful.
