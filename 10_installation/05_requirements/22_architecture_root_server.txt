[[Server_supported_OS, the list of supported Operating Systems for Root server]]

===== For Rudder Root Server

The following operating systems are supported as a Root server:

GNU/Linux:

* Debian 7 and 8

* RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / RHEL-like 6 and 7

* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP1, 11 SP3

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise), 14.04 LTS (Trusty)


==== Hardware specifications and sizing for Rudder Root Server

A dedicated server is strongly recommended, either physical or virtual with at least one dedicated core.
Rudder Server runs on both 32 (if available) and 64 bit versions of every supported Operating System.

===== Memory

The required amount of RAM mainly depends on the number of managed nodes. A general rule for the minimal value is:

* less than 50 nodes: 2GB
* between 50 and 1000 nodes: 4GB
* more than 1000 nodes: 4GB + 1GB of RAM by 500 nodes above 1000.

When managing more than 1000 nodes, we also recommend you to use a multiserver
installation for Rudder as described in chapter <<multiserver-rudder, Multiserver Rudder>>.

For large installations, you should also tune the amount of RAM given to:

* the web application, as explained in the section
<<_configure_ram_allocated_to_jetty, about webapplication RAM configuration>> 
* PostgresSQL, as explained in the <<_optimize_postgresql_server, Optimize PostgreSQL Server>> section

===== Disk

The PostgreSQL database will take up most disk space needed by Rudder. The storage
necessary for the database can be estimated by counting around
150 to 400 kB by Directive, by Node and by day of retention of node's
execution reports (the default is 4 days):

----
max_space = number of Directives * number of Nodes * retention duration in days * 400 kB
----

For example, a default installation with 500 nodes and an average of 
50 Directives by node, should require between 14 GB and 38 GB of disk space for PostgreSQL. 

Follow the <<_reports_retention, Reports Retention>> section to configure the
retention duration.
