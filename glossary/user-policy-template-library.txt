User Policy Template Library:: 

This is an organized list of the Policy Templates selected and modified by the
user. By default this list is the same as the Reference Policy Template Library.
Policy Templates can be disabled or deleted, and then activated again with a
simple drag and drop. Categories can be reorganised according to the desired
taxonomy. A Policy Template can appear only once in the Library.
