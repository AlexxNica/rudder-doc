"Big red button":: 

A button, on the right top side of every page of Rudder web interface, to
command the emergency stop of the agents. This stop will be implicitly done in
less than 10 minutes, or can be done immediately if the port 5309 TCP from the
Rudder Root Server (or each relay server) is open to each nodes. This feature is
detailed in the user documentation.
