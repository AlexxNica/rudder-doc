==== Policy Template upgrade

When you upgrade the Rudder Policy Templates packages to a new version, a
new version of the Policy Template library is copied to /opt/rudder/share/policy-templates.

The Policy Template library is managed using a GIT tree.
Thus, you can not simply copy the files from /opt/rudder/share/policy-templates to Rudder's
storage, you also have to follow this simple procedure:

[TIP] 

====

Please make sure that any edition you made is on a non existent version of a Policy Template,
or you are likely to have your editions replaced by the reference implementation !
Of course, GIT will keep history if your modifications are already commited but this would be
an annoyance.

====

* Jump to the Rudder Policy Template tree

----

cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/policy-templates

----

* Copy the reference Policy Template library to your local tree

----

cp -a /opt/rudder/share/policy-templates/* .

----

* Update the GIT repository to match the new tree state
