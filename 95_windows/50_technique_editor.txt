=== Technique editor with DSC

DSC Generic Methods are shipped with the Rudder dsc plugin. Some are specific for Windows managed systems (like the Registry management), and the others are the DSC version of existing generic methods.

A filter is available in the Technique Editor to select either all generic methods, generic methods available for classic agent, and generic method available for DSC agent, so that you can choose relevant methods for the type of nodes you need to manage
