=== Archives

In the 'Admnistration > Archives' section of the Rudder Server web interface, you
can export and import the configuration of Rudder Groups, Directives and Rules.
You can either archive the complete configuration, or only the subset dedicated
to Groups, Directives or Rules.

Active Rudder configuration is stored in a LDAP tree.

The content of this tree can be exported into a file tree containing +xml+
files, into +/var/rudder/configuration-repository+. This file tree is under
version control, using 'git'. At exportation time, a 'git tag' is created in this
repository, and referenced in the Rudder Webapp. Each change in the Rudder web
interface is also commited in the repository.

The content of this repository can be imported into Rudder.

==== Archive usecases

The archive feature of Rudder allows to:

* Exchange configuration between multiple Rudder instances;

* Keep an history of major changes.

===== Changes testing

Export the current configuration of Rudder before you begin to make any change
you have to test: if anything goes wrong, you can return to this archived state.

===== Changes qualification

Assuming you have multiple Rudder instances, each on dedicated for the
developement, qualification and production environment. You can prepare the
changes on the developement instance, export an archive, deploy this archive on
the qualification environment, then on the production environment.

[TIP]

====

Use 'git' to copy the files from an environment to another.

For instance, using one unique git repository you can follow this workflow:

. On Rudder test: 

.. Use Rudder web interface to prepare your policy;

.. Create an archive;

.. +git push+ to the central repository;

. On Rudder production: 

.. +git pull+ from the central repository;

.. Use  Rudder web interface to import the qualified archive.

====

===== Deploy a preconfigured instance

Assuming you are preparing a complete Policy integration for a client.

. In your labs:

.. Prepare the configuration for Groups, Directives and Rules;

.. Export the Policy

.. Create an archive containing the content of the configuration repository
(+zip+ file).

. At the client place:

.. Unpack the archive in +/var/rudder/configuration-repository+

.. +git commit -a +

.. Restore the configurations from the last commit
