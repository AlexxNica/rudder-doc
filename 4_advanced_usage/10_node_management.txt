=== Node management

==== Reinitialize policies for a Node

To reinitialize the policies for a Node, delete the local copy of the Applied
Policies fetched from the Rudder Server, and create a new local copy of the
initial promises.

----

root@node:~# rm -rf /var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/*
root@node:~# cp -a /opt/rudder/share/initial-promises/* /var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/

----

At next run of the Rudder Agent (it runs every five minutes), the initial promises will be used. 

[CAUTION]

====

Use this procedure with caution: the Applied Policies of a Node should never get
broken, unless some major change has occurred on the Rudder infrastructure, like
a full reinstallation of the Rudder Server.

====

==== Change the agent run schedule

By default, the agent runs on all nodes every 5 minutes. You can modify this value in
*Administration* -> *Settings* -> *Agent Run Schedule*, as well as the "splay time"
across nodes (a random delay that alters scheduled run time, intended to spread
load across nodes).

[WARNING]

====

When reducing notably the run interval length, reporting can be in 'No report' state
until the next run of the agent, which can take up to the previous (longer) interval.
