== Upgrade

This short chapter covers the upgrade of the Rudder Server Root and Rudder Agent
from older versions to the latest version, 4.0.

The upgrade is quite similar to the installation.

A big effort has been made to ensure that all upgrade steps are performed
automatically by packaging scripts. Therefore, you shouldn't have to do any
upgrade procedures manually, but you will note that several data migrations
occur during the upgrade process.

==== Upgrade from Rudder 3.1 or 3.2

Migration from 3.1 or 3.2 are supported, so you can upgrade directly to 4.0.

If you migrate from a 3.1 release older than 3.1.11, you have to upgrade
you server before your agents (as 4.0 agents are not compatible with old servers).

==== Upgrade from Rudder 3.0 or older

Direct upgrades from 3.0.x and older are no longer supported on 4.0.
If you are still running one of those, either on servers or nodes,
please first upgrade to one of the supported versions above, and then upgrade to 4.0.
