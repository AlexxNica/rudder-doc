=== Install Rudder Agent on SuSE


==== Add the Rudder packages repository


Add the URL of the Normation repository, by typing the next command on a SLES 11 node:

----

root@rudder-node:~# zypper ar -n "Rudder RPM Repositories" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.3/SLES_11_SP1/ Rudder

----

Or this one on a SLES 10 node:

----
root@rudder-node:~# zypper ar -n "Rudder RPM Repositories" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.3/SLES_10_SP3/ Rudder
----

Then, update your local package database to retrieve the list of packages
available on our repository:

----

root@rudder-node:~# zypper ref

----

==== Install your Rudder Agent

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-agent:

----

root@rudder-server:~# zypper install rudder-agent

----

Type in the IP address of the Rudder Root Server in the following file

----

echo *root_server_IP_address* > /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat

----

[TIP]

====

We advise you to use the +IP address+ of the Rudder Root Server. The DNS name of
this server can also be accepted if you have a complete DNS infrastructure
matching the IP of the Nodes with their hostnames. 

====

Finally, start the agent:

----

service rudder-agent start

----
