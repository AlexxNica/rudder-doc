== Install Rudder Server

This chapter covers the installation of a Rudder Root Server, from the
specification of the underlying server, to the initial setup of the application.

Before all, you need to setup a server according to 
<<Server_supported_OS, the server specifications>>. You should also
<<configure_the_network, configure the network>>. These topics are covered in the
Architecture chapter.

Ideally, this machine should have Internet access, but this is not a strict requirement.
