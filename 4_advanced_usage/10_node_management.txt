=== Node management

==== Reinitialize policies for a Node

To reinitialize the policies for a Node, delete the local copy of the Applied
Policies fetched from the Rudder Server, and create a new local copy of the
initial promises.

----

rudder agent reset

----

At next run of the Rudder Agent (it runs every five minutes), the initial promises will be used. 

[CAUTION]

====

Use this procedure with caution: the Applied policies of a node should never get
broken, unless some major change has occured on the Rudder infrastructure, like
a full reinstallation of the Rudder Server.
