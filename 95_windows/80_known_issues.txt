=== Known issues

On the first run of the Rudder DSC agent CLI in a Powershell terminal, you may have the following error message:

----

Import-LocalizedData : Cannot find the Windows PowerShell data file 'MSFT_ServiceResource.strings.psd1' in directory 'C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\Modules\PSDesiredStateConfiguration\PSProviders\MSFT_ServiceResource\\', or in any parent culture directories.

----

This does not prevent the correct execution of the agent, and next runs in the same terminal will not exhibit the error
