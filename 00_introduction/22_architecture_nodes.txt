.Windows Nodes

Installing Rudder on Windows requires the commercial version of CFEngine (CFEngine Enterprise).
Hence, as a starting point, we suggest that you only use Linux machines. Once
you are accustomed to Rudder, please contact Normation to obtain a demo version for
Windows platforms.

It is possible to use Rudder on other platforms than the ones listed here.
However, we haven't tested the application on them, and can't currently supply
any packages for them. Moreover, some Techniques may not work properly. If you
wish to try Rudder on other systems, please get in touch with us!
